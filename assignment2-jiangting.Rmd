## R Markdown

This is an **R Markdown** document. In a code chunk make a data frame from the air quality dataset. In the same chunk clean the dataset from NA values.
*Knit the RMarkdown file and make a PDF file*:

```{r x}
x <- data.frame(airquality)
x
good <- complete.cases(x) ###extract the non-NA data from frame airquality
good
x[good,]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r airquality, echo=FALSE}
plot(airquality)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
